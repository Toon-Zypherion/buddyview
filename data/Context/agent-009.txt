personal brand strategy:

build agents into a sustainable income to allow breathing room for experimentation.
define north star post angle (=100 hooks, 100 img templates)
document north star agentic workflow 

company info:
note: it's all scattered around in different websites and holding names, but essentially we are vibe-coding content creation agents as former marketeers. currently, company is ugcreative.ai:
-e-commerce like webshop featuring agents instead of products
-reusable scaffolds so new viral workflows can be cloned in hours
-the buyer’s moment of need and script the narrative (north star for every sprint)

roadmap: open to new direction

career details: dropshipping (shopify) + fb ads + google ads in 2016-2021. Building LLM integrations since 2022. failed 2 companies (ppcc.ai, llm for google search ads + others we were marketing as companies instead of extentions of personal brand )

short-term goals: 
-first sale in 1 week (=on the first of november). 
-2 new agents launch in november. 
-linkedin is as active as it can be in november.

(ex)-companies:
-ppcc.ai: llm for google search ads campaigns; from url to campaign
-zypherion: old internal software agency that's dusty
-complexify: generate viral img templates for linkedin (current: ecomproductimage->influencer holding->socials->results)
-ugcreative.ai: monthly fee influencer video generation platform that will be turned into agent ecom website
-postcraft: linkedin post builder to help Toon(=user) (linkedin toon=achiel) craft posts efficiently (template->hook->snippets)
-buddyview: map where Toon can view his llm agents and workforce (including your place of birth)

first agent:

this is a draft table of the 2 first agents we will be selling and pushing social media content to:
